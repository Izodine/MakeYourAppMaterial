# MakeYourAppMaterial
Android Developer Nanodegree Project

# Goal 
The goal of this project was to add material design standards to an existing app. This included
changing colors and behavior of the app to provide a better and more elegant experience
to the user

# How was this accomplished?
I did this by utilizing the guide available by Google. Most notably, the theme
extends App Compat, contains primary, primaryDark, and accent colors, and the app uses
a CoordinatorLayout coupled with other elements that allow the ActionBar to collapse as the user scrolls.
